goto : https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

download and install xampp, take a note of where u put the installation folder.

once it's installed run the control pannel and start the apache module

where u installed xammp there should be a folder that has a holder called htdocs
put this folder in there. so just the UwsPhaserProject folder, the entire thing.

once thats done just goto chrome or whatever browser u use and type "localhost/UwsPhaserProject"
and the game should just pop up :)

obviously this version wont update itself but we can get that going once were back at uni, 
or over skype its up to u guys
